# RMC-TotalRisk Version 1.0 Example Projects
This repository is designed to showcase several example projects that demonstrate the capabilities of **RMC-TotalRisk**. As time permits, additional examples will be added to highlight more advanced features and use cases.

To help you get started, weâ€™ve included two simple example projects: one for **dam safety** risk analysis and the other for **levee safety** risk analysis. These examples are intended to demonstrate the basic functionality of the software and provide step-by-step guidance on setting up a straightforward risk analysis.
