# RMC-TotalRisk
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Risk Management Center (RMC) introduces RMC-TotalRisk, a comprehensive risk analysis software designed to support dam and levee safety investment decisions. It performs quantitative risk calculations for a system using hazard, system response, and consequence functions. RMC-TotalRisk is part of an integrated software suite designed to support risk assessments. The software features a fully integrated modeling platform, including a modern graphical user interface, data entry, report-quality charts, and diagnostic tools. RMC-TotalRisk can evaluate risk for a single component with multiple failure modes, as well as for complex systems comprised of multiple components.

RMC-TotalRisk has an intuitive workflow to guide users through the required inputs, including importing flood hazard curves from RMC-BestFit and RMC-RFA, and importing consequence estimates from LifeSim. Users can develop system response functions using a built-in event tree analysis tool. TotalRisk is also capable of running a full Monte Carlo analysis, simulating uncertainty in every input, with runtimes on the order of a few seconds to minutes.
