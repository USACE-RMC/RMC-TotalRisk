# RMC-TotalRisk
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers TotalRisk software (RMC-TotalRisk) performs quantitative risk calculations for a system from a set of hazard, system response, and consequence functions. RMC-TotalRisk is part of an integrated software suite designed to support risk assessments. The software features a fully integrated modeling platform, including a modern graphical user interface, data entry, report quality charts, and diagnostic tools. RMC-TotalRisk can evaluate risk for a single component with multiple failure modes and a complex system comprised of multiple components. 

RMC-TotalRisk has an intuitive workflow to step the user through the required inputs, including importing flood hazard curves from RMC-BestFit and RMC-RFA, and importing consequence estimates from LifeSim. The user can develop system response functions using a built-in event tree analysis control.
