# RMC-TotalRisk
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers TotalRisk software (RMC-TotalRisk) performs quantitative risk calculations for a system from a set of hazard, system response, and consequence functions. RMC-TotalRisk is part of an integrated software suite designed to support risk assessments. The software features a fully integrated modeling platform, including a modern graphical user interface, data entry, report quality charts, and diagnostic tools. RMC-TotalRisk can evaluate risk for a single component with multiple failure modes and a complex system comprised of multiple components. 

RMC-TotalRisk has an intuitive workflow to step the user through the required inputs, including importing flood hazard curves from RMC-BestFit and RMC-RFA, and importing consequence estimates from LifeSim. The user can develop system response functions using a built-in event tree analysis control.

## Downloads
* [Download Version 1.0 Beta](https://github.com/USACE-RMC/RMC-TotalRisk/blob/dccfa961d8bbfa753c1156d27c750fbc35b0ff17/RMC-TotalRisk_Beta_11-28-23.zip)

RMC-TotalRisk is currently being beta tested by a large group of practitioners in the public and private sector. Version 1.0 of the software and documentation is also being externally peer reviewed by industry experts. An official release of version 1.0 is anticipated for later in 2023. 

Two example RMC-TotalRisk projects can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/USACE-RMC/RMC-TotalRisk/blob/1c471ad71a0ee32569c982a00b6405cfd127c70f/Example%20Projects.zip). Also included is a project file that has all of the typical event tree configurations used by the RMC for dam and levee risk analyses. Any one of these event trees can be created from a template in RMC-TotalRisk.

The RMC-TotalRisk projects used for verification testing can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/USACE-RMC/RMC-TotalRisk/blob/421a276268ace4e1b8e61c8502324f9866fe6af9/Verification%20Projects.zip). This download also includes example R scripts for replicating some of the tests.
