# RMC-TotalRisk
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers TotalRisk software (RMC-TotalRisk) performs quantitative risk calculations for a system from a set of hazard, transform, system response, and consequence functions. RMC-TotalRisk is part of an integrated software suite that supports risk assessments. The software features a fully integrated modeling platform, including a modern graphical user interface, data entry, report quality charts, and diagnostic tools. RMC-TotalRisk can evaluate risk for a single component with multiple failure modes and a complex system comprised of multiple components.

RMC-TotalRisk is a powerful risk analysis software designed with an intuitive and easy-to-use interface. It simplifies the complexity of risk assessments by connecting the core components of risk — hazard, transform, response, and consequences — through a clear and intuitive risk diagram. The software generates a comprehensive range of risk outputs, including excess, background, total, failure, and non-failure risks. Each component of the analysis can incorporate uncertainty, and the software supports modeling multiple locations with distinct failure modes as separate system components, streamlining system-level risk evaluations.
